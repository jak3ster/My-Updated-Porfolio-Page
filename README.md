# Updated Portfolio

This is an updated portfolio as part of building toward being employer-competitive.

## Description

This homework helped me create a weather dashboard application that uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML, CSS and jQuery. Using `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

Updating initial portfolio page to include Project #1 and the homework assignments as follows: Password Generator, Timed Code Quiz, Weather Dashboard and Work Day Scheduler; GitHub profile is updated with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 with (2) of exemplary assignments; Updated resume and LinkedIn profile to include current progress in the coding boot camp to build toward being employer-competitiveness.

Being part of the web developer community means show casing and sharing projects towards applying for jobs and is a part of the journey as a developer.
